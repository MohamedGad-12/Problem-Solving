# Description:
* Inverting a Coin Triangle Consider an equilateral triangle formed by closely packed pennies or other identical coins like the one shown in the figure below. 	 
  (The centers of the coins are assumed to be at the points of the equilateral triangular lattice.)
  Use iterative improvement method to design an algorithm to flip the triangle upside down in the minimum number of moves if on each move you can slide one coin 
  at a time to its new position.
